# VAE
Variational Autoencoder is a probablistic model that assumes the data can be described by latent variable Z. The VAE model aims to maximize the log-likelihood of data. For the purpose of backpropagation, reparameterization trick is used. This model is used to detect anomolous class (trousers) from normal classes (other types of clothes).
